## About Me

I'm a systems programmer that got my start when I was 10 learning [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (incredibly empowering platform). I quickly got into game programming with OpenGL and released my first mobile game onto Google Play. Since then, I've discovered that I love to design high-performance, robust systems! Discovering Rust only made it more fun. Programming language design is a guilty pleasure and aviation is a long-time hobby. I live out in the country where the traffic is wonderful and you can see the stars at night.
